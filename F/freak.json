        "A freak is not a weirdo but is often confused with a hipster. Freaks are generally preoccupied with youth culture, self-actualization, discovery, and self-image; an interest in strange or bizarre subjects or wanting to be the first to do something or consume something; exposing people as phonies; or in wanting to be interesting or original. Examples of freaks include, punks, poets, dancers, strippers, citizen journalists, vloggers, gonzo writers, audiophiles, hoarders, junk-haulers, baristas, hitchhikers, beatniks, street vendors, graphic designers, anti-comedians, gurus, disc jockeys, mascots, math-a-magicians, or performers of the street, rodeo, or circus."
